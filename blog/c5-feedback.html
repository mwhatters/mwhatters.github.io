        <h3>Feedback Loop</h3>
        <h4>May 6th, 2015</h4>

        <section>
          <p>Paired Programming is a new concept to me, as I'm sure it is to the majority, if not all, of my peers attending Dev Bootcamp. Not only that, but paired programming is somewhat of a new concept to a lot of experienced programmers as well -- many of my friends in the tech business don't program with their employees, at least not in the context that we've been doing so. And having a few novice months of programming experience under my belt prior to entering DBC, I can understand why they wouldn't be too keen on the idea. Coding with someone puts you in a vunerable position. It forces you to separate yourself from any sort of traditional method you might have used to tackle a problem, and instead go into a problem together with someone who might have looked at the problem in an entirely different way.</p>

          <p>More often than not, this has been the case. My roommate, Jacob, is also a member of the DBC Bumblebees, and we've been pairing relatively often through the past 5 weeks of the program. Being together in the same room with someone helps with communication, but it also creates more vulnerability. You can sense someones dissatisfaction with a particular approach, you can feel their body heat rising if a disagreement arises, but nothing is said. Tension becomes palpable, especially if the problem isn't going as smoothly as expected. That in-person experience can amplify that feeback loop of either positive or negative energy, depending on the nature of the session. And on multiple occasions, I've felt such energies (in both directions) in pairing with Jake. In this post, rather than focus on the feedback I've recieved from Socrates (which has been largely positive, thankfully!) I would likt to focus on the in-person feedback that one can recieve in the midst of a pairing session, how to approach those feelings, and how to tackle them in a productive and meaningful way.</p>

          <h6>Pride &amp; Anger</h6>
          <p>Let me preface this section by first saying that I absolutely love pairing with Jake. We both look at problems differently, and usually have drastically different ideas of how to tackle them. Though from those two perspectives, we end up reaching a solution that takes the best bits from both approaches and molds them together in what I consider to be a superior solution to what either of us were originally thinking. Seeing those results is not only productive, it's also really cool. We are both outspoken, more naturally inclined to drive, and can become quite animated in solving problems -- this can sometimes result in pretty explosive sessions.</p>

          <p>Through working with him, however, I've realized that I look at my code more emotionally than I had previously thought. I've noticed in myself, feelings of pride when I know I've come up with the correct solution, but also feelings of anger when I realize that my approach wasn't the optimal one, or even worse, shame when I realize that my solution isn't working. In these moments of struggle, I realize how difficult it is for me to ask for help from another peer. This is a problem. Why is it that I become defensive, or even upset, in light of seeing someone elses solution that might be better than mine? At times, I've felt these things while tackling problems -- and though I don't address it in person, I can't help but reflect upon it later. These emotions are ultimately rooted in my own insecurities as a programmer.</p>

          <p>To fix this problem, I've decided to take a couple approaches:
                <ol>
                  <li>Tackle my fear of 'imposter' syndrome by asking for help endlessly. Or, at the very least, asking for help every time I need it.</li>
                  <li>Abandon the notion of 'admiring' my own code, or even anothers. Escape narcissism by finishing a problem, knowing it is the best I can do, and move on. Refactor when more information is obtained, or when a suggestion is made that sparks a new approach.</li>
                  <li>Accept my ignorance and embrace the fact that I do not have the best answers. More often than not, a better answer can be found.</li>
                  <li>Be more open about any of the emotions I might be experiencing as I work with others.</li>
                </ol>
              I should make it clear that, despite my efforts to escape my own insecurities, I don't want to overcorrect the problem by become timid or afraid to act in paired sessions. If I have a strong opinion about how we should approach a problem, I will let it be known. But I won't let those strong opinions influence my emotional state. Knowing now that there is so much emotion tied to paired-programming, I intend to catch them before they start to brew. And if they do brew, I will need to address them directly.</p>

          <h6>EQ</h6>

          <p>The paragraph above pretty much sounds like something out of the lecture that we were asked to watch prior to the interview we had when applying to Dev Bootcamp. It's ironic that only now do I understand why the program puts such an emphasis on EQ. Ruby is a complex language that provide a multiplicity of ways to solve a single problem -- there is no absolutely correct way to solve the challenges we are presented with every week, and from that lack of 'correctness' in code spawns te may different ideas conjured in thinking about how to tackle a problem. Especially as we begin to get into modelling objects with classes, I understand that, despite what many think of as a '1+1=2' profession, problem solving often boils down to how a problem is subdivided into its smaller elements -- and there's no truly correct way to boil a complex problem down into simple arithmatic. I've learned to appreciate this fact more and more as I work with my roommate and others through our paired programming sessions.</p>

          <p>I had a really good talk with my roommate the other night about how design decisions are made, how objects communicate with one another, and what programming is really about. Through this conversation I realized one, key thing: I have so, so much more to learn about programming &amp;engineering. As I continue to be humbled throughout this program, I will continue to keep asking questions, let go of my impassioned attachment to my ideas, and work with others in a way that is open and honest.</p>
