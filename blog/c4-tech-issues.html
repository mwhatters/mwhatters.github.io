        <h3>Tech XOR Soul</h3>
        <h4>April 30, 2015</h4>

        <section>

          <p>When I first moved to San Francisco, I worked at a local coffee shop. I spent time getting to know and grow with the Inner Richmond community, and through over a year of interacting with these people, I began to feel a sense of 'home'. A lot of my friends and peers also worked and work in the service industry, and during those times, we shared a lot of our stories, our experiences with locals, and very often, our misgivings about 'socially inept techies', 'soulless tech folk', 'assholes'. Needless to say, I moved to the city in the midst of rapid growth, and a lot of people weren't adjusting as well as others.</p>

          <p>These same friends, with whom I shared these stories with were, unsurprisingly, not as supportive of my decision to do this program. "Don't become an asshole like the rest of them", they said. "Don't forget that it is the tech industry that is driving hard working people who've lived here for decades out of San Francisco". "Don't forget that the tech industry is gentrifying and destroying local communities". These sort of (albeit slightly hyperbolic) reminders lead me to ask the question: How and why have things gotten this way? What is it about the tech industry that causes such vitriol?</p>

          <h5>Gentrification</h6>

          <p>Gentrification in recent history has become a buzz word that pervades most conversations regarding San Francisco. It's really easy to talk with locals about how quickly SF is 'changing' -- and for good reason. It <em>is</em> changing. A new industry has been growing faster than weeds, and the small little peninsula we find ourselve situation upon cannot bear to support the vast number of people who have lived here and who want to live here. When it comes to who <em>gets</em> to live here, for better or for worse, the wealthy will more often than not find themselves winning out. Perhaps it's wrong of the tech industry to impede upon culturally historic grounds in the way it has, but the fact of the matter is that we live under a system that values production and consumption more than the preservation of an historic neighborhood or culture. Capitalism does not care about history. It caters to what can make money *now*. And despite the cries of my peers who claim the the tech industry is ruining San Francisco culture, they'll be surprised to find that these sort of revolutions are what define our history as a country -- and they may very well be a part of the change as well.</p>

          <p>I run the risk of being insensitive by making these claims. I, for one, wholly support the notion that we respect and integrate with the environment to which we choose to inhabit. But with that in mind, such a notion might be easier said than done. From my understanding, gentrification is a set of conditions from which a new, more profitable 'culture' emerges. It is not something that is consciously decided by one person, or any group of people. If anyone is the catalyst for gentrification, it's consumerism.</p>

          <h5>What can we do</h5>

          <p>How can an industry accused of contributing to the problems that face working and lower-class San Franciscans successfully change it's behavior for the better? Despite the social debate around economic concernes, I think a few things could be done on a more human level to really help reduce the divide between locals and newcomers, and though I'm no expert, these are some ideas that I will try to employ as I continue to grow in this city that I love.</p>

          <h6>Integrate thyself.</h6>

          <p>A lot of the bad wrap techies get from my friends is that they live in a high-class bubble of frivolous apps and gadgets, turning a blind eye to the environment they are encapsulated withtin. (Those these same friends might ironically also be playing angry birds on their phone, or browsing facebook every 15 minutes, I think the point they make still might have some truth to it.) Especially in today's culture of constant distraction, I find it imperative that we interact with our community. Become a regular at a local coffee shop, make friends with fellow locals, pull yourself out of the void that can be worklife and have a human conversation with someone who does something different than you. Put down your phone once in a while, take a breath, go to a local show, meet people in your neighborhood. Tip your waiters, for christ's sake. There's a lot to see in this city, and in my experience as a barista, I've met a lot of people who don't really seem to appreciate that fact. To be honest, this might not be just a tech problem, but a problem with expedient SF culture as a whole.</p>

          <h6>Become involved in social matters.</h6>

          <p>The 'tech bro' is the stereotype that generates the most ire from friends, and I think they have a fair point when they say that our industry can find itself alarmingly distant from social justice issues and politics. I think a lot of the problems with the tech industry is that applications are made that don't really do anything meaningful -- practical, sure, but impactful? Not usually. I think it's important that people who want to contribute to an industry as vibrant as tech really make an effort to become involved in the issues that their community find important. Actively pursue better living conditions for the lower class -- promote social justice for minorities, women and the LGBT community -- espouse standards of living that emphasize moderation and preservation of resources over overconsumption and consumerism (if such a thing is even possible). Don't be a money-making void.</p>

          <h5>Conclusion</h5>

          <p>Perhaps it is wrong of me to make such suggestions to an industry I find myself wanting to enter. Perhaps I don't know what the industry is 'really' like, and when I do become a developer, perhaps my feelings about these matters will change. But with that said, I think the values I espoused in this article are not just useful values for those in the tech industry to adopt; these really are, at the end of the day, human values. I humbly think we would all be wise to follow them.</p>
