        <h3>Asking Wisely</h3>
        <h4>June 5th, 2015</h4>

        <section>
          <p>
            I've spent the majority of my life around people who know more than I do -- from musicianship to coding, I'm constantly surrounded by a wealth of knowledge I can tap into. I feel lucky. Not everyone has that resource at their disposal. Sure, stack overflow is a wonderful tool, but having that direct, person-to-person contact can make a huge difference in not only what you ask, but how you learn it.
          </p>

          <p>
            That being said, I've asked so many dumb questions. Questions that don't even make sense, stemmed in a more fundamental confusion of the topics being discussed. This generally has caused confusion from my peers, and the consequences can be negative. If someone can't even properly ask a question, how can they be expected to learn?
          </p>

          <p>
            Below I'm going to include some ideas on how to make sure the questions we ask are good questions. Without completely rehashing the very wonderful <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">Stack Overflow</a> guide on asking good questions, I want to focus in on how we can approach asking a question that will not guarantee success, but will help foster a relationship between questioner and questionee for the better.
          </p>

          <h5>First, Fundamentals</h6>

            <p>
              Before we can begin to ask a question, we first need to understand if we have a solid conceptual grasp of the topic we are asking about. When I first started using Ruby, I would ask people questions related to concepts that I thought I had a strong grasp of. I'd ask questions like "how can I use arrays to create a map between certain keys and it's values?" This question, though specific, is clearly misinformed. The question itself is flawed by the fundamental misunderstanding of what arrays are meant to do and how they can be used.
            </p>

            <p>
              This first step can be the hardest to tackle. How can one know if they have a solid conceptual understanding of a topic? They key is in breaking it down. We can take the above question and ask ourselves questions about the question. Fundamentally, what is an Array? How do keys and values relate to certain data structures in programming? We'll quickly (and obviously) find that the question suffers from a misunderstanding of these concepts. The key to asking a good question is first understanding the building blocks that lead to it -- if we don't know what an Array really is at its core (a zero-indexed container for other objects), how can we begin to understand what sort of questions to ask about them?
            </p>

            <p>
              To really understand the context of a question, and to ensure that the questions we ask are good, rather than stemming from fundamental misunderstandings, is to tackle the fundamentals head-on with a little tool called:
            </p>

            <h5>The Internet</h6>

              <p>
                Priming yourself prior to asking a question is the BEST way to make sure the question is a good one. Use google to research the fundamentals if those are alluding you, or restructure your question dealing with these fundamental concepts instead. Usethe internet to gain a context for the question you are asking -- has it already been answered on stack overflow? Perhaps then all you need is clarification from a mentor rather than the asking of a question. Does the answer completely allude you? Copy and paste the specific parts of the question that you don't understand, and break it down. Research those broken down parts.
              </p>

              <p>
                One of the nice things about going onsite for DBC is that we'll have the additional aid of mentors to help get us through these questions and problems. Maybe a 30 minute research journey can be solved quickly and concisely by a mentor. But even with that said, knowing *how* to search for the proper answers to the building blocks that construct and contextualize your question is key.
              </p>

              <p>
                There's one last thing I wan't to talk about, and that is:
              </p>

              <h5>Learning how to speak about code</h5>

              <p>
                This last topic of blogversation is one that I myself have found difficulties in dealing with. Typing about code is generally much easier than speaking about it. Have you ever found yourself getting lost in a conversation regarding a deeply nested javascript object or ruby hash? It's rather easy to lose track of what one is referring to in a question, especially when the more advanced topics invoke more complex questions about them.
              </p>

              <p>
                The key to answering this problem I've found is by resorting to the written word, or commenting the code you write that doesn't make sense. Unsure of why something is working, even though it is? Comment through it, using written language to break it down. Present this written language to your instructor for a much swifter answer to the problem. If you write a line of code that you suddenly get lost in, write it out.
              </p>

              <p>
                Another good approach, one that I intend to try as we work through the coming weeks, is the rubber duck approach. Talk to the inanimate object in the room, pretend like it knows nothing. Doing so forces you to really learn *how* to speak about what techniques and methods you employ in finding a solution to the problem.
              </p>

            <h5>The Wrapup</h6>

              <p>
                Asking a good question can be difficult, but it ultimately boils down to this: use the internet to read up on the topic beforehand, ensuring a solid foundation to the question at hand (if the fundamentals confuse you, reconsider your question, or perhaps find a question that will properly lead you to the path of more advanced knowledge). Learn how to speak about these topics through practice and repetition. Asking a good question is like flexing a muscle -- it might be hard at first, but it's okay. It's okay to ask a bad question, as long as you learn from it. Once we've established where our understanding lies, asking the best questions for ourselfs and our mentors will be made that much easier.

          My name's Marshall Hattersley. I'm a budding programmer, web developer, artist and musician. Currently attending Dev Bootcamp to gain more chops in the web development world and get a few projects under my belt.

          When not frantically coding, you'll most likely find me playing music. My band, <a href="http://www.vespersails.com" target="_blank">Vesper Sails</a> is a San Francisco-based rock group with a strong interest in jazz, math, and folk. I play rhythm guitar and sing lead vocals. We play once or twice a month in the city, so do come check us out -- you can find where we'll play next on the website.
