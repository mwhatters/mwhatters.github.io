          <h3>Welcome to my blog, friends and enemies.</h3>
            <p>
            If you are an enemy, LEAVE! Why must you persist?<br><br>
            My name is Marshall. I hope you enjoy the page that you are now visiting. I made it for a school project, as I am part of the Dev Bootcamp experience. I won't lie in saying that making it was very frustrating at times -- CSS can be a very, very painful experience. But hey, no pain, no gain? I think?<br><br>
            Anywho, here is where I'll be posting all of my reflections, blog posts related to the program, and hopefully, in time, some other things related to my other interests. Though for the next couple months, I don't suspect there being any chance to engage in extracurriculars... such is the life.
            <br><br>
            For the next few weeks during the offsite program, you should expect to see major improvements to this site. This was thrown together in a few hours on a thursday, I suspect I'll have a bit more time to really get the hang of this whole interwebs things.
