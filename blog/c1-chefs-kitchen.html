        <h3>Why I am Participating in DBC</h3>
        <h4>April 9, 2015</h4>

      <section>
    <p>
      Choosing to go to coding school is a borderline-insane thing thing to do. At least it feels that way; I'm quitting my job, uprooting my life, and entering into a complete realm of the unknown. On top of that, I'm paying 14,000 dollars to do this. I don't think most rational people would pay 14,000 dollars to uproot their lives and plunge themselves into a world of uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, I feel that the decision to completely change myself is not just rational -- it also feels right. Despite the stress and the anxiety that accompanies making such severe changes, this program I think will really allow me to integrate with a community of like-minded people who share similar anxieties, fears, etc... but most importantly, a willingness to really become fully immersed in a process and education that will ultimately make them better. I think that most people in this program -- beyond completing phase 0 -- are more than ready to dedicate almost all of their time towards the goals of self-betterment and really jump into the immense ocean of knowledge that embodies the tech industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly this program has a financial incentive, and it's worth addressing. A common question I've asked myself, leading up to phase 0, is "Am I doing this because I love the creative and challenging aspects of programming? Or am I doing this because I want to pay off my student loans and live comfortably?" I think that, despite the romantic notion of claiming that the whole DBC experience is completely oriented towards learning of a new skill, it's quite obvious that this program finds success in the financial benefits that accompany this career path. But I think that's okay. Living in a place life SF is incredibly challenging -- the rent is incredibly high, the social demand is constant, and things aren't going to get cheaper anytime soon. I don't think I should be ashamed in saying that I am pursuing these goals because I want to ensure for myself a better financial future. I want to take control of my education and my career, and it just so happens that, for better or for worse, our financial stability encompasses a major part of our livelihood. Some are gifted with the ability to surpass these needs and comforts through alternative means or changes in lifestyle, but I choose to address these concerned by learning something that not only I love, but also know will help me live debt-free.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be honest, I still struggle with the dichotomy between creative/logical/educational desires and the need for financial livelihood. But I know that this program, at its core, is not about money. It's about learning. When in the heat of madness during phase 1, spending 16 hours a day and 6 days a weeks mad into code, I don't think that money will be on my mind. Learning will. Like Shereef mentioned in the video that we watched in preparation for this blog post, we come here not to consume a package, and expect results. We come here to cook something amazing, to be in the kitchen together, to really explore how something is made, and why we should make it. Results are not expected -- they are realized.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the mentality I plan to take with me as I move forward throughout this program. There will be struggles, and yes, the nerves are still present, and yes, there will be humbling experiences, but I'm here to be the best I possibly can be, and realize my full potential. My expectations of this program may change as time goes on but my desires to learn will not. I'm ready to enter the kitchen.
