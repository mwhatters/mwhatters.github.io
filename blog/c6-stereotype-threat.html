        <h3>Hiding Place</h3>
        <h4>May 13th, 2015</h4>

        <section>
          <p>
            I am a white middle class guy who could easily pass as a straight man. Being in that position has many advantages. I don't have to experience any sort of potential discrimination, because when I sense I'm in a homophobic crowd, I can easily sneak through the conversation, undetected and un-outed. I become an imposter when needed.
          </p>

          <p>
            I work in a mainly straight tech-ish environment. When asked, I'm sure most everyone there would vocalize their support of LGBT rights and lifestyles, but that vocalization is often overlooked or forgotten in everyday conversation. When I first started working there, I was presumed to be a straight guy. I was thrusted into a 'straight bro' context, expected to discuss my straightness with (most of) my male and female peers alike. When I first joined the team, I felt pressured to fit in. In most social situations I try to avoid hopping into imposter mode as much as I can, but in an environment where your appearance matters and perceptions of you are important, being a fresh face in a new job, I couldn't help but use my 'straightness' as a defense mechanism.
          </p>

          <p>
            When lying about yourself (or even shielding others from the truth with silence) seems like a necessary step towards social acceptance, whether it be in the workplace or otherwise, something is wrong. Perhaps I could be overthinking it. Perhaps I should have just been myself to my peers right away and resisted the pressure of being a straight guy. But being different, especially in a context where fitting in is so important, can be detrimental, regardless of any vocalized acceptance of a marginalized (or once marginalized) group. You become defined by your differences rather than your similarities. I've seen it happen, and sadly, sometimes that risk cannot be immediately taken.
          </p>

          <p>
            I grew up in a religious and conservative town, where I became awfully good about keeping parts of myself private. Looking back now, I realize just how incredibly damaging that guarding can be. It's easy to do in the moment but incredibly painful to think about after the fact.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the months flew by in the job I'm about to quit to leave DBC, I became more confortable expressing my true thoughts with my peers. But by that time, I had already been established as a valuable employee. I regret that I felt such pressure to fit in. I regret that I gave in to that pressure. And everytime I continue to shield a part of myself from normal conversation in an attempt to 'fit in', it stings.
          </p>

          <p>
            What exites me most about DBC is that there seems to be a very open dialogue about who we are as people, not just programmers. I intend to take full advantage of this fact. When we are open emotionally with one another, we can work better as a team. With nothing to hide, there's much less to lose.
          </p>

          <p>
            I feel grateful in knowing that being gay is becoming an accepted part of worklife culture. San Francisco is ahead of the bell curve when it comes to social matters, and as I continue to live here, I recognize that these 'issues' have been fading away as people continue to think about who they are, their insecurities, in relation to others. But I still have some work to do about resiting the urge to hide myself, and I hope that, as we work together, we won't need to find a hiding place.

          <p>
          My name's Marshall Hattersley. I'm a budding programmer, web developer, artist and musician. Currently attending Dev Bootcamp to gain more chops in the web development world and get a few projects under my belt.
        </p>

        <p>
          When not frantically coding, you'll most likely find me playing music. My band, <a href="http://www.vespersails.com" target="_blank">Vesper Sails</a> is a San Francisco-based rock group with a strong interest in jazz, math, and folk. I play rhythm guitar and sing lead vocals. We play once or twice a month in the city, so do come check us out -- you can find where we'll play next on the website.
