        <h3>Conflict</h3>
        <h4>May 29th, 2015</h4>

        <section>

        <p>
          I consider myself a pretty perceptive person. I say this not with hubris, but with a genuine care for making sure I'm not acting out of line and an even playing field. I also consider myself a person of strong opinions. The balance of staying true to one's preferences whilst also maintaining that even playing field I've become hyper-aware of throughout these nine weeks. And like it or not, but all paired programming sessions work like miniature conflict resolutions. While they don't involve yelling or anger (necessarily), they do give two people from differing places the challenge of coming together to create a unified solution to a problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I think about my own personal conflicts, and how I've come to find myself where I am today, I look no farther than college, where I was a young philosophy major living amongst redwoods in Santa Cruz. I spent that time doing a lot of hiking and a lot of conflict resolution. Most of my classes involved debate, where I learned to temper my emotions. I did a lot of thinking about conflict during these times and realized that, more often than not, the anger from conflicts stem from within us, from our own insecurities or doubts about our positions.
        </p>

        <p>
          I generally found myself most angry during intellectual or political discussion in these classes. What I started doing to curb these feelings was approach the way in which I talked to people differently. Instead of accusing them of taking a particular action and placing all blame on them, I would speak to the person as 'we' -- it created a sense of teamwork, the problem became a shared burden, and the sense of 'me v you' became diminished. This helped an incredible amount while dealing with particular problems related to philosophical group work, and I've taken that approach to coding school, where the conversation veers away from 'me and you' to 'we'.
        </p>

        <p>
          In knowing this fact, I've been able to curb my emotional attachment to certain methods or approaches. Doing so allows me to explore conflict resolution without an emotional glaze to shroud the real nature of whatever we are resolving. That's the key to success, in my opinion.

          <p>
          My name's Marshall Hattersley. I'm a budding programmer, web developer, artist and musician. Currently attending Dev Bootcamp to gain more chops in the web development world and get a few projects under my belt.
        </p>

        <p>
          When not frantically coding, you'll most likely find me playing music. My band, <a href="http://www.vespersails.com" target="_blank">Vesper Sails</a> is a San Francisco-based rock group with a strong interest in jazz, math, and folk. I play rhythm guitar and sing lead vocals. We play once or twice a month in the city, so do come check us out -- you can find where we'll play next on the website.
