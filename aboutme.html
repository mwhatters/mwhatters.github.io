          <p>I was born in Lakeside, San Diego in 1990, son to Barby and Mark Hattersley, adored parents and talented musicians. In San Diego I pursued music &amp; theater arts. Despite my affinity for warm beaches and sunny weather, I left southern California for Santa Cruz, where I obtained a BA in philosophy, among other things. During my studies I developed a vested interested in logic and religious studies. Despite my proclivity for redwood forests, rock climbing and existentialism, I abandoned my natural landscape in favor of the urban grind that is San Francisco. A resident since 2013, my latent interest in logic has resurfaced, compelling me to study computer logic &amp; programming. My desire for becoming a skilled programmer is amplified by my creative desires -- to make something utilitarian, ethically conscious, and inspiring using the frameworks developed by those much smarter than I. I liken it to using an instrument, taking advantage of the notes and chords, all already discovered, to invent a progression not heard prior. The beauty of programming is that one can find such elegance in the logic of a method, much like the logic of music. I intent to play my programming. </p>

          If you are an enemy, LEAVE! Why must you persist?<br><br>
          My name is Marshall. I hope you enjoy the page that you are now visiting. I made it for a school project, as I am part of the Dev Bootcamp experience. I won't lie in saying that making it was very frustrating at times -- CSS can be a very, very painful experience. But hey, no pain, no gain? I think?<br><br>
          Anywho, here is where I'll be posting all of my reflections, blog posts related to the program, and hopefully, in time, some other things related to my other interests. Though for the next couple months, I don't suspect there being any chance to engage in extracurriculars... such is the life.
          <br><br>
          For the next few weeks during the offsite program, you should expect to see major improvements to this site. This was thrown together in a few hours on a thursday, I suspect I'll have a bit more time to really get the hang of this whole interwebs things.
