        <h3>Values.</h3>
        <h4>May 22, 2015</h4>

        <section>

          <p>
            The cultural assignment this week asks that we choose a few values of ours that we aspire to hold in our lived, then asks of us to rate how often we find ourself actually committed to those values. Rather than rate myself on a scale of 1-5, I will instead reflect on three values I find important and assess, in words, how I think I've come to embody (or not embody) those values.
          </p>

          <h5>Efficiency</h5>

          <p>
            This value immediately stood out to me. In these 9 weeks of offsite study, efficiency is not only a value -- it's almost a requirement. I hate the feeling of time wasted, especially in the process of studying, or solving a problem, or learning. When I solve a problem efficinetly and intelligently, I get the sense that "yeah, I can really do this!", but when I reach a wall or stumble, I am reminded of my own weaknessess. I have a sense that aspiring to this value may be a direct result of my fear of failure. Perhaps this is a result of the stereotype I sometimes feel I need to embody -- a 'straight white, dominant man' -- perhaps I feel this need to embody that stereotype as a direct reaction to my own misguided feelings about my own personality and sexuality, and the stereotypes associated with them. It's tough to say, and I honestly don't know the answers. But efficiency, for better or for worse, helps me feel good about what I'm doing.
          </p>

          <h5>Introspection</h5>

          <p>
            Something I find myself missing in my life is my inwardness -- my ability to think about myself, my place in this world, who I am and what I value. Sometimes I feel like I just don't have the time or energy to deal with those insights, or even worse, I sometimes feel as if those questions aren't important anymore. This I know couldn't be farther from the truth, but the narrowness of my experiences here in San Francisco can sometimes orient me towards that attitude.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am currently not doing a very good job of being introspective. I find myself working day to night, falling asleep after studying, preferring not to think about anything at all. I don't imagine this will change during the program; in fact, it might become more intense. That being said, I am grateful that the program takes emotional intelligence and health so seriously. I don't want to forget about the things I love and the person I am in the midst of this programming pursuit. Though I'm ready to dedicate two months of my life towards full and complete immersion, I realize that I will need to keep myself in check, and occasional force myself to be introspective as I live day to day, especially in a city so noisy.
          </p>

          <h5>Music</h5>

          <p>
            My passion for music stems directly from my passion for self-reflection, thinking inward, and spending time alone in nature or quiet places. Music is, for me, an incredibly introspective tool. I play in a band in SF, but my own written folk tunes I play for myself, and I sing them for myself. I cannot forget that music is an incredible part of my life during DBC. Recently I have had some great inspiration for a couple songs, but I find my lack of introspection makes lyric writing and empassioned song more difficult to conjure. Since introspection and music are so closely related, perhaps I'll make an effort to spend free time using music as an introspective tool. Music will be a good tool to lift me up after a difficult day, and I should not forget to take afvantage of this while I work at DBC.

          If you are an enemy, LEAVE! Why must you persist?<br><br>
          My name is Marshall. I hope you enjoy the page that you are now visiting. I made it for a school project, as I am part of the Dev Bootcamp experience. I won't lie in saying that making it was very frustrating at times -- CSS can be a very, very painful experience. But hey, no pain, no gain? I think?<br><br>
          Anywho, here is where I'll be posting all of my reflections, blog posts related to the program, and hopefully, in time, some other things related to my other interests. Though for the next couple months, I don't suspect there being any chance to engage in extracurriculars... such is the life.
          <br><br>
          For the next few weeks during the offsite program, you should expect to see major improvements to this site. This was thrown together in a few hours on a thursday, I suspect I'll have a bit more time to really get the hang of this whole interwebs things.
