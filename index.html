      <h3>Some music, for a change</h3>

      <p>We've spent the better part of 9 weeks working with code, and I've been required to write two blog posts a week about it. Given that I just did a rehash of my site, I figured it might be a good idea *not* to feature a coding blog post on the front page to start. Sometimes a good break is most needed. Instead I've decided that it would be a good idea to shamelessly talk about folk music.</p>

      <p>
        I'm a sucker for good folk. I've noticed that many choose to listen to more upbeat tunes while they study or work, but I've found that the softer stuff helped me to focus more than the loud stuff. It's entirely possible that this could be a reflection of my inherently somber nature -- after all, folk music isn't necessarily a happy affair. That being said, it's generally pretty beautiful and makes for a good backdrop to an otherwise studious evening.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, if you're at all like me and enjoy a good, slow ensemble to your frantic coding mishaps, I'd recommend taking a look at the following records, as you should find them just right to capture that mood:
      </p>


      <img src="imgs/blog/sufjancarrielowell.jpg" alt="Sufjan Stevens: Carrie And Lowell">

      <h4>Sufjan Stevens: Carrie &amp; Lowell</h4>

      <p>
        Starting with the absolutely most depressing, Carrie and Lowell is a recently released album, the latest addition to Sufjan Steven's excellent body of work. The music in this record takes a decidedly darker turn from his earlier work, however; gone are the days of the vibrant flutters in Michigan and Illinois, the bombastic glitchiness of Enjoy Your Rabbit. This is Sufjan at his most stripped down. With minimal instrumentation and lyrics that seem to tell us more about this artist than we've heard before, it provides a great means of introspection as well as a soft backdrop on a quiet evening.
      </p>

      <p>
        Granted, this record is not for everyone. When I say it's an extremely dark record, I do not exaggerate -- this can either make someone feel calm (like myself) or bring one to the verge of tears, depending on your mood and current situation. But it is, without a doubt, an incredibly beautiful album.
      </p>

      <img src="imgs/blog/lauramarling.jpg" alt="Laura Marling: I Speak Because I Can">

      <h4>Laura Marling: I Speak Because I Can</h4>

      <p>
        Along similar lines as the previous album, <i>I Speak Because I Can</i> is a record I've grown to love over the last few years I've had it with me. Though not as dark as a sad Sufjan Album, Laura Marling evokes a deep empathy and sadness when she sings -- as well as a solid technical guitar accompaniment -- reminiscent of Joni Mitchell. Her lyrics pierce the soul, with songs like 'Rambling Man' and 'Made by Maid' bringing to life a rich narrative. Laura Sings in a way that feels much older than she actually is -- there is a wisdom in her voice, and it's not difficult to be entranced by that wisdom as she carries you through this record effortlessly.

          If you are an enemy, LEAVE! Why must you persist?<br><br>
          My name is Marshall. I hope you enjoy the page that you are now visiting. I made it for a school project, as I am part of the Dev Bootcamp experience. I won't lie in saying that making it was very frustrating at times -- CSS can be a very, very painful experience. But hey, no pain, no gain? I think?<br><br>
          Anywho, here is where I'll be posting all of my reflections, blog posts related to the program, and hopefully, in time, some other things related to my other interests. Though for the next couple months, I don't suspect there being any chance to engage in extracurriculars... such is the life.
          <br><br>
          For the next few weeks during the offsite program, you should expect to see major improvements to this site. This was thrown together in a few hours on a thursday, I suspect I'll have a bit more time to really get the hang of this whole interwebs things.
