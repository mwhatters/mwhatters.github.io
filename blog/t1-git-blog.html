  <h1>Why Version Control?</h1>
  <h2>Time, Change, and Loss Prevention</h2>
  <h4>April 9, 2015</h4>

    Let's imagine I create a project on my computer. It's a project that I've spent quite a great deal of time on, and I'm very proud of. Let's now say that I need to make a massive change to this project. A new situation or change of circumstances calls for a refactoring of the project. I want to make these changes, but I don't want to risk making a mistake and ruin what I have created. One might consider making a copy of the project, putting it on a different directory within the computer. That may seem like a viable option, but we run the risk of forgetting which directory is the copy and which is the original (is there anybody out there who HASN'T had this confusion before?). Worse, what if our data is wiped out on our local system? Where do we access the data then? We might have a backup but it could be an older version. Let's also imagine that I want to invite a remote group of people, each on their own system, to work on specific parts of this project. How do we communicate? How do we make decisions? How do we properly manage this project without completely stepping on one another's toes, or worse, losing the data entirely? What if someone makes a mistake?

    The answer is version control. Specifically, Distributed Version Control. Not only will the project data exist on a server, but it will also exist on every local system that is currently working on the project. If the data is somehow lost or currently unreachable on your system, those working on the project will still be able to work, sharing their changes with one another, each with a specific version of the project that they cloned to their system. Git is a program that helps do exactly this, establishing the version control system, and Github takes it a step further, establishing a distributed version control system that monitors changes on a project, help manage different versions of a project, merge branches of the same project together, and communicate with the master version of the project in the form of pushing, sending pull requests, or fetching changes already submitted and accepted. The visuals presented on the official Git website I found of great help: <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control">Git - About Version Control</a>

    How does Git Track changes? What happens when we commit a change? Essentially, a commit is a 'snapshot' of a project, taken by Git, and logged into the history of all changes that have been made and committed. If a commit in the past needs to be returned to, we can rewind the 'tape', so to speak, and continue working from that point in the past. Genius!

    Github is essentially a way of managing Git repositories in GUI form. It helps put a face to the sometimes confusing processes involved in Git. I am a novice at Git and GitHub. And frankly, it can be confusing and frustrating, especially when sorting through a massive project that has many branches, changes often, and has many people working on it. However, this frustration is sometimes necessary towards true learning and management of a project, as without a centerpiece like Git and Github, change would be halted entirely, or the project thrown into chaos. Git and Github offers a solution to the possibility of Data being lost, or ruined, or changed unexpectedly. It allows us to keep a record of every change made to a project, allow for multiple people to collaborate remotely, and prevent any serious loss that might be the result of a server crashing or a mistake being made. If loss prevention is the problem, Git is the answer.
