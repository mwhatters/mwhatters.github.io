          <h5>The Learner, The Loner Dichotomy</h5>

          <p>
            When I first took a look through the Phase-0 Prep manual, fresh-faced and optimistic, I thought I had a pretty clear grasp of what my learning
            style was. Or at least, I thought it was something I wouldn't have to think about -- people just get their work done and move on, right? I quickly realized that, prior to really taking a look into my own methods of learning, that I had no clear way of describing what sort of preferences I had when it came to a learning environment, nor could I really asses what things I didn't like about learning. I was under the assumption that these questions didn't matter. I assumed that most of my learning was a solo endeavor -- I didn't need to ask others for help, and when I did, I asked google. Even today I see myself resisting these needs.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, having had some time to work with others, to struggle through some CSS, and working under the guidance of a DBC instructor, I know that understanding my learning style is an important process in knowing not just what to learn and where to learn, but <em>how</em> to learn. I need to break free of the solo journey and really jump into the program with this group of people. I imagine that, when the onsite instruction begins, I should be able to appreciate this fact in its entirety, but It would be wise for me to start adopting the mentality early. To do so, I need to understand how to describe my learning process.
          </p>

          <h5>The Abstract Sequential Thinker</h5>

          <p>
            My pass at the <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Thinking Style Quiz</a> resulted in relatively even scores, with a slight preference towards the abstracted styles of thinking, most specifically, the "Abstract Sequential" thinker. When first taking the test, I didn't really find the information to be that useful to me. But as we've continued throught he first Unit of DBC Phase 0, I began to see bits and pieces of these results creep their way into real-life situations, the first, and most obvious one being:
          </p>

          <h6>I like to work alone.</h6>

          <p>
            Pairing is difficult! I struggle with it. When I'm in a pairing session, I realize my need to be driving, or at least, taking a backseat driving role in getting through the problems. During a few of my pairing sessions, I felt myself monopolozing the conversation in an attempt to get through the problems in what I thought was the best way possible. I didn't realize until after my first pairing session that I really did a poor job of trying to let the other person take a stab at tackling the problem. My propensity towards working alone often shrouds my ability to work constructively with others -- understanding this fact in the past few days has been a huge help towards actively working to curb my sometimes-overbearing ways.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus far, understanding my own needs as a worker and a learner has helped me come a long way in terms of working with others. Luckily, I think I've also discovered a positive thinking trend I tend to exhibit, that being:
          </p>

          <h6>I like to be placed in stimulating environments.</h6>

          <p>
            And boy, has DBS thus far been a stimulating experience. Having survived the treachery of week two (paired with the very large musical obligations I had during the weekends), I realized that I actually <em>enjoyed</em> being pushed like that. I found it exhilerating. I learned more, and at a faster pace. I wonder what lies ahead for me, especially during the onsite. I tend to get amped up by risky situations that call for a lot of work to be done. Perhaps I am a latent work-aholic.
          </p>

          <p>
            In an attempt to make sure I don't push myself overboard, I intend to do a better job of timeboxing myself while working, in an attempt to maintain sanity, think more clearly about problems, and don't become such a hassle to my peers. Time maneagement is something I think I'm pretty good at, but I tend to rabbit hole, so I need to be able to keep that in check while I manage multiple responsibilities during my run of the onsite program.
          </p>

          <h5>The Final Word</h5>

          <p>
            Overall, I think these past three weeks have helped me to understand the value of a growth-based mindset when working in an environment. Week 3 of offsite-DBC has been admittidley easy -- given that I've had a few months of ruby under my belt, working at it almost every day, I feel more than comfortable with the work we were required to do this week. However, I shouldn't adopt the mentality that just because I can do the work easily, it doesn't mean that I'm in any way smarter than any of my peers. I've simply spent more time studying the way the language works. Knowledge isn't something that you have, it is something that is learned, and understanding/appreciating the values of a growth-based mindset is the best way to work with my peers as we all get through Phase 0 together.

          If you are an enemy, LEAVE! Why must you persist?<br><br>
          My name is Marshall. I hope you enjoy the page that you are now visiting. I made it for a school project, as I am part of the Dev Bootcamp experience. I won't lie in saying that making it was very frustrating at times -- CSS can be a very, very painful experience. But hey, no pain, no gain? I think?<br><br>
          Anywho, here is where I'll be posting all of my reflections, blog posts related to the program, and hopefully, in time, some other things related to my other interests. Though for the next couple months, I don't suspect there being any chance to engage in extracurriculars... such is the life.
          <br><br>
          For the next few weeks during the offsite program, you should expect to see major improvements to this site. This was thrown together in a few hours on a thursday, I suspect I'll have a bit more time to really get the hang of this whole interwebs things.
